<h1>My list of hobbies</h1>

<ol>
<h2><li>Sport</li></h2>
<p>My favourite sport is football. I like watching football on TV with my dad and 
    I used to play it as a kid with my childhood friends. 
    I've also been in a team for 2 years, representing our country's national sport
    and it was the best experience of my life because I got the chance to visit my 
    own country and its beautiful places. 
</p>

<h2><li>Puzzles</li></h2>
<p>I like spending my time solving puzzles or crossword because 
    it keeps my mind "busy", it's refreshing and it's a good way to distract myself
    from my phone or PC.

<h2><li>Volunteering</li></h2>
<p>2 years ago when I joined a volunteer organization from my university, 
    I didn't realised I was going to love it and learn so many things about 
    commuication, team work, time management and myself. It is a great hobby 
    and I'm very grateful for it.</p>

<h2><li>Gaming</li></h2>
<p>This is one of my greatest hobbies and I think I got it from my brother. 
    I really enjoy watching different type of gameplay including action, horror 
    from my favourite streamers. Sometimes I spend my free time playing video games on my 
    computer or PS4 and my favourite game so far is Far Cry 6.</p>
